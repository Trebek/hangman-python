Hangman, in Python
=============================

**[Click here to play a demo!](http://repl.it/LhR/5)**

My version of the classic word guessing game, Hangman. I'm sure there are much
better/easier ways of making this game, and it's probably more elaborate than 
it needs to be, but it seems to work. Maybe I'll refine it a bit at some point.
I wrote this from sratch, so if you use it, or modify it, please give me a 
little credit. It is all that I ask.  

When playing, enter "exit" or "quit" as a guess to quit the game.

You can make your own txt file of words by following these two easy steps:
    
1. Create a new txt file, called "words.txt" in the same folder as this 
   game.
2. Open the txt file and enter each word on it's own line. Save the txt.

####Features

- Easy to edit word list built into source, or you can load words from a 
txt file of words.
- Displays the secret word, with any rightly guessed letters revealed.
- Displays all of the letters player has guessed, in alphabetical order.
- No duplicate words. Once a word is solved, it's removed from the list.
    - When all of the words have been solved, the game ends.
- Awesome ASCII art hangman. Okay, so it's not that awesome.
- Keeps score (10 points per solved word).
